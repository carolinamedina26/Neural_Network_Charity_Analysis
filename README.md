# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview 
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results 
### Data processing 
First, we identify the dependent variable which is " IS_SUCCESFULL", this row of data displays if the applicant was succesfull or not after funding.

The feature of our dataset are the reamining variables, althouhg, we decided to **drop "ET & NAMES"** since they do not offer information that will allows to inprove our model.

### Trainning & Evaluation of Model

For this model,we use two layers for a deep learning model, with 80 and 30 nodes in each one.

### Results
Our model display an 73% perfomance. Which is sufficit for the prupose of this analysis. For that reason, we decided to optimize our model by grouping names per application times.

After this founding, we decided to group applicants with <4 application together, that way reduced the outliers. 

Finally our optomized model **increase its preforming with a result of 79% accuracy.**
